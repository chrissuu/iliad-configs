----Setting Up a Linux Server----

Since the process was rather tedious, here's some documentation for what I did to set a remote linux server, Odyssey on my home pc. 

The main idea is that with port forwarding, you can set up a server which you can ssh into from anywhere.

I am running Ubuntu 24.04.1, LTS (The full machine info is available in machines_info.txt, under Odyssey)

My router model is from Verizon

Steps:

(1) Setting a static IP address for your machine 

This is necessary because the local ip (IPv4 (?)) can often change and when it does, you won't be able to ssh into your machine (without changing some stuff on your router)

Chances are, when you're ssh'ing into your machine over the internet, you probably won't have access to your router.

    ->Settings > Network > Wired (FOR ETHERNET) > Gear Box > IPv4
        *Under this section, click "Manual"
        *DNS, Routes can stay Automatic
        *Enter an IP address that you want
            -> Tip*** Run "$ ip addr" in your shell first and get your IPv4 and use that address (don't wanna screw other ip 
               addresses over that might be used was my reasoning - not sure if it matters tho)
    ->Netmask: use the netmask under ip addr. (Mine was 24, which is, I believe, equivalent to 255.255.255.0)

The ip address you are looking for when you run "$ ip addr" is under inet, under wlp5s0 for internet or enp4s0 for ethernet (at least for my Ubuntu version)

(2)  Setting up port forwarding

Log into your router by going to (usually) 196.82.0.1 or 196.82.1.1, and looking 
at the back of your router (usually) for the password.

Look for a tab that says "Port Forwarding" when you log into your router, and add a new "Rule"

(At least that was what it was for Verizon)

You'll be met with a "Create Rule" form with the following parameters:
    (1) Application
        -> Name of the application / rule. In my case, I put something like "Odyssey-SSH"

    (2) Original Port
        -> 22 is the default for SSH (look into sshd_config for that, if the parameter 
           "Port xxxx" is highlighted, (i.e., # is prepended) then your port is probably 22). 
           Alternatively, you can run "$ sudo systemctl status ssh" and see what port it is listening on.

    (3) Protocol
        -> TCP, this I searched up, I don't think you have to worry too much about what it does, just use TCP

    (4) Fwd to addr
        -> Here, put the static IP you set your server to be

    (5) Fwd to port
        -> Here, use a different port number, I recommend 2222 since anything below 1000(?) is reserved (sometimes)
           This is for some extra security. (Read somewhere that malicious agents may be listening over port 22)

    (6) Schedule
        -> Always

(3) Firewall

We need to make sure that the firewall allows certain connections. In particular, I added 22/tcp and 2222/tcp. Take this with a grain of salt, but *I think* that port 22 is used when ssh'ing locally over LAN and then port 2222 is used (since you set up port forwarding) when ssh'ing over the internet. Either way, if something doesn't work, just make sure both of these are active(?)

For Ubuntu, this entails running:

    $ sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
    $ sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp

(4) Security Features

We're going to set up passphrase instead of password log in. This is arguably safer, and recommended. The reason this is safer is because when you (or someone else) tries ssh'ing into the machine, it checks whether you have the public key in your ssh configs and then basically doesn't let you even try to ssh into the machine (via some password) without it. 

    -> $ ssh-keygen
    -> choose location you want
    -> ssh-copy-id <user>@<public_ip> -p <port you choose in 2.5>
        This copies your public key into the server, allowing you to connect
    -> use the password to log in
    -> ALTERNATIVELY: you can keep password auth enabled, ssh into your server, then copy the public key into your server, and then disable password auth (next section)

Now, hopefully rsa key was successfully set up.

Nvim / nano / vim / vi into /etc/ssh/sshd_config and uncomment the line (and change no to yes as necessary):

    PubKeyAuthentication yes
    AuthorizedKeyFile
    PasswordAuthentication no

----Troubleshooting tips----
Try restarting your server, restarting ssh, and resetting firewall if things don't work. 

$ sudo systemctl status ssh

Returns ssh status

$ sudo systemctl restart ssh

Restarts ssh server
